# NetBoot-Daemon
Netboot daemon

Netboot daemon combines the C# Version of my bootpd and the BINL-Server (C++) and the Mini-BINL-Server into one complete
Solution. I hopefully want implement complete RBCP (running in bootpd) and also BSDP support. Both other projects has that fundermental features in there.

Goal is also to handle PXE boot accross subnets like VPN (co working with Windows RIS and WDS)
